## Hey, I'm Robert.

I really don't have much to say, just take a look around my profile.

___

### What I'm familiar with:
I'm mainly working for all technical related projects for [@Compliance-Resource-Pack](https://github.com/Compliance-Resource-Pack), a resource pack which doubles and/or quadruples the texture resolution of Minecraft and possibly other games in the future.
For this project I'm working with HTML, CSS, a teeny tiny bit of ruby, JavaScript using Node.js and various other things related to websites, bots, automation and apps.

I also love doing contributions to projects that I love and use daily.
